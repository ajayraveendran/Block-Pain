# Block-Pain


A platformer game to help teach me the basics of HTML5 game development. The objective is to avoid falling or hitting any of the spikes. The game has 5 levels which aren't chronological. If you're unlucky you might get the hardest level first!

### Movements

Use the up, down , left and right arrow keys to move the player. The character has momentum physics built in i.e. it'll build up speed from stand still, until it reaches max velocity.

### Technologies used

* HTML 5
* [Phaser HTML5 Game framework](https://phaser.io/)
* [Tiled Map editor](https://www.mapeditor.org/) to create tilesets and maps.
* A bunch of Javascript

### Challenges faced

By far the hardest bit was to get my head around the functions in Phaser. Working with Javascript to solve web dev challenges uses a certain set of functions which I got reasonably confortable with. However with Phaser, there comes an enormous library of functions of which I ended up using a tiny amount. Even with these, trying to understand what each of them does was a challenge, however the guys at phaser have done a fantastic job with their function naming. The docs are really good too.

### Overall learnings

Game dev is hard but fun. Working with Javascript to create games instead of a conventional website, has given me a new found respect for the programming language - powerful stuff.

I cannot speak highly enough about what the guys at Phaser have managed to create. Being a noob at programming in the scheme of things, my brain hurts just thinking about the amount of work that would have gone into creating a framework like it.

Working with Tiled was a blast - quite intuitive and straight forward to work with.

DT our instructor says, projects are never finished, only abandoned. This even truer with game dev. There is so much you can do and scope creep can be very real. However in this case, I do believe I acheived what I set out to i.e. learn some of the basics of in-browser game development.

### Credits

This project would not have been possible without the awesome tutorials from [Mike Westhad](www.mikewesthad.com)
Mike's used Robert's tileset in his tutorial. Here's a link if any of you are interested [0x72 Industrial](https://0x72.itch.io/16x16-industrial-tileset)
